**Objective: A number of files have been added to the `localrepo` directory. Stage these files so they can be committed to the repository.**

Use the `git add <_filepattern_>` command to stage files.

All files can be added in one go by executing `git add .`

## Stage Files

1. Verify the status of the repo before staging
 * `git status`{{copy}}
2. Stage the files using a single command
 * `git add .`{{copy}}
3. Verify the status of the repo after staging
 * `git status`{{copy}}

**Ensure all files are staged before continuing**
