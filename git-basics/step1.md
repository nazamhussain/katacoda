To create a new local repoistory, you'll use the `git init` command.

`git init` is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repoistory.

Executing this command will create a new `.git` subdirectory in the root of your chosen working directory. It will also create the default master branch.

The `git init` command can be used in one of two ways:
 * **Method 1**
 * **Method 2**

## Method 1

This is an _example_ of creating a scenario and running a **command**

`echo 'Hello World'`{{copy}}


## Method 2

This is an _example_ of creating a scenario and running a **command**

`echo 'Hello World'`{{copy}}
