**Objective: Create a repo in the `localrepo` directory**

Use the `git init` command to create a new local repo.

Executing this command will create a new `.git` subdirectory in the root of your chosen directory. It will also create the default master branch.

The `git init` command can be used to initialize a repo in one of two ways:
 * Method 1 - in the current directory by simply issuing `git init`
 * Method 2 - in the specified directory by issuing `git init /path/to/your/directory` - _the directory will be created if it doesn't already exist_

## Method 1

1. Navigate in to the `localrepo` directory
 * `cd localrepo`{{copy}}
2. Navigate in to the `localrepo` directory
 * `git status`{{copy}}
 * `git init`{{copy}}
 * `git status`{{copy}}


## Method 2

This is an _example_ of creating a scenario and running a **command**

`echo 'Hello World'`{{copy}}


## Method 2

This is an _example_ of creating a scenario and running a **command**

`echo 'Hello World'`{{copy}}
